1) This code can be used to preprocess the data obtained from maxmind. 
2) updateMaxMindRange-MyLocation.go - updates the ipv4 ranges to have location Ids that represent its location.
3) compressMaxMindRange-MyLocation.go - compresses the file obtained from above and generates a binary and ascii file.
